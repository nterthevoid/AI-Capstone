* **2.4 RAG Architectures:** 
    * Discuss the concept of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and its benefits for improving chatbot performance and accuracy.

**3. Methodology**

* **3.1 System Design:**
    * Design the overall system architecture, including components such as:
        * Frontend (Web Interface)
        * Backend (API Gateway, Chatbot Logic, Database, etc.)
        * AI Model Integration
        * Security Modules (SSO, 2FA, Authorization)
        * Cloud Infrastructure (AWS services)
    * Create detailed system diagrams and flowcharts.
* **3.2 Technology Stack:**
    * **Frontend:** Select a suitable frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue.js, Angular).
    * **Backend:** Utilize Python with frameworks like Flask or Django.
    * **Database:** Choose a suitable database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for storing user data and chatbot interactions.
    * **AI Model:** Select and integrate a suitable LLM (e.g., GPT models, Gemini, Bard).
    * **Cloud Services:** Utilize AWS services for deployment, scaling, and management.
* **3.3 Development Process:**
    * Agile development methodology (e.g., Scrum) with iterative development and testing.
    * Version control system (e.g., Git) for tracking code changes and collaboration.

**4. Implementation**

* **4.1 Development:**
    * Develop the frontend, backend, and chatbot logic.
    * Integrate the chosen LLM and implement the RAG architecture.
    * Develop and implement security features (SSO, 2FA, access control).
    * Implement file upload and processing functionality.
    * Develop and test the API endpoints.
* **4.2 Dockerization:**
    * Containerize the application and its dependencies using Docker.
* **4.3 AWS Deployment:**
    * Deploy the Dockerized application on AWS using the selected service (e.g., ECS, EKS).
    * Configure and manage the deployment using AWS tools and services.

**5. Testing and Evaluation**

* **5.1 Unit Testing:** 
    * Conduct unit tests for individual components of the application.
* **5.2 Integration Testing:** 
    * Test the integration of different components of the system.
